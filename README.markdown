### Help needed :)

` 
Everything working just great here with the exception that we can't kill the python process after its "do shell script"...
Just didn't get yet how to stop the script from hangin' up after a do shell script command ... :(
So at this point, the only way to stop droopy is killing Python in the Terminal, which is a bad deal.
If you know the answer ... muah muah muah! Thanks you! :D

### Info

This AppleScript helps you setup and run [droopy](http://stackp.online.fr/droopy).
Droopy is a mini Web server whose sole purpose is to let others upload files to your computer.

### Settings

- Path to your avatar
- Path to your local droopy installation
- Path to the upload directory (if different from the one droopy already has).

### Parameters

**Name**: The name/nickname others will see in the upload page.
**Port**: Port to be used by droopy.

### Requirements

Droopy is a python script so you'll need to have [Python](http://python.org/) installed.
